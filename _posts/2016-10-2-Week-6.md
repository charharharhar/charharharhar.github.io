title: Week 6
---

_What did you do this past week?_ I did a lot of interview preparation for interviews this past week and this coming week. 

_What's in your way?_ Honestly, there seems to be a lot of time to do things, but it's really hard for me to manage it well and prioritze the right things. I feel like I invest too much time in doing assignments for other classes inefficiently, leaving me with less time to do everything else.

_What will you do next week?_ In this coming week, I have 4 interviews (blessed, but stressed...), a coding assessment for another company due, and the test for this class on Thursday. Honestly, it all seems quite overwhelming, but I'm excited for this week to be over.


##Class Experience
This past week, the differences and similarities between iterables and iterators were pounded into our brains. At least, that's the hope. In class, we do quite a bit of writing implementations for certain methods that exist in Python already, such as map, reduce, and other functions. I think this method solidifies the basics and ensures that we actually understand what a particular function is doing. I also have a hunch that this is preparing us for the upcoming test, which will be conducted over Canvas. I've never had a computer science course where our exams were on Canvas, so I'm a little anxious and hoping I don't accidentally press "Submit" before I'm actually finished.


#### Tip of the Week
You can do a little bit of interview preparation and a little bit of review of data structures every day. I wish I had invested more time in it in my early years. Now I feel under-prepared for the level I should be at as a senior.
Resources such as Cracking the Coding Interview, LeetCode, CareerCup, and other books/sites have been quite helpful for me.
